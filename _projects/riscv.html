  <p>
    In a team of two students, I designed a single-cycle processor that implemented a portion of the
    <a href="https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/"> RISC-V instruction set architecture</a>,
    as a final project for <strong>Brown ENGN 1640 - Design of
    Computing Systems</strong>, taught by Professor Xinming Huang.
  </p> 
  <p>
    Our Verilog design was stable at frequencies slightly above 100 MHz. Full credit on the project
    was granted for designs that could compute factorials at clock frequencies of at least 80 MHz.
  </p>
  <p>
    The processor supported the following instructions:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>ADD</strong>, <strong>ADDI</strong>, and <strong>SUB</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>LW</strong> and <strong>SW</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>AND</strong> and <strong>OR</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>MUL</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>SLLI</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>BEQ</strong> and <strong>BNE</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>JAL</strong> and <strong>JALR</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>
