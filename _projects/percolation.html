    Study of mathematical 
    <a href='http://www-math.mit.edu/~dav/projectsB.pdf'>percolation</a> (on
    trees of valence k) in the style of 
    <a href='https://math.mit.edu/~hrm/papers/lab-course.pdf'>MIT's Project Laboratory in Mathematics</a>, 
    with Qianfan Chen (<a href="https://github.com/FanC096">FanC096</a>)
    and Rachel Fuller (<a href="https://github.com/rfuller1">rfuller1</a>).
  </p> 
  <p>
    Without the use of Internet resources or existing literature,
    we formed predictions for how expected cluster size
    varies with tree valence and and closed-edge probability,
    wrote code for two distinct models of percolation on finite graphs, and
    analyzed simluation results to explain the differences between the two
    approaches.

    This project was completed as part of <strong>Brown's
    Undergraduate Mathematics Projects (BUMP)</strong> for Summer 2020, 
    and our excellent graduate student mentor was Tom Stone.
