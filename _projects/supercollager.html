<div class='projdescription'>
Photo-mosaic generator, with variable tile resolution (in pixels) and image resolution (in tiles).

<p>Tiles are formed from a set of user-uploaded images. A user-uploaded target image is
made into a mosaic by assigning each square region in the target image to the
tile with the “nearest” average RGB color vector (using Euclidean distances).</p>
