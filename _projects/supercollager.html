<div class='projdescription'>
Photo-mosaic generator, with variable tile resolution (in pixels) and image resolution (in tiles).

  <p>Tiles are formed from a set of user-uploaded images. A user-uploaded target image is
  made into a mosaic by assigning each square region in the target image to the
  tile with the “nearest” average RGB color vector (using Euclidean distances).</p>

    <!-- The supercollager page SHOULD be an absolute link because it's a separate set of HTML files entirely. -->
    <!-- It's just also deployed to GitHub, so it has a similar URL to this site. -->
