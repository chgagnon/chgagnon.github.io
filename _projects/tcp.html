    <a href="https://castleman.space/projects/tcpip/">Thomas Castleman</a>
    and I implemented IP (using UDP as the link layer) and then TCP (on top of IP) in Rust, as the semester-long project for
    <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1680/">Brown CS 1680 - Computer Networks</a>,
    taught by Nicholas DeMarinis.
  </p>

  <p>
    The IP layer implements 
    <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2453">RIP (RFC 2453)</a>
    for routing, which dynamically updates routing tables as nodes join and leave the network.
    We added support for <strong>Echo</strong>, <strong>Echo Reply</strong>,
     and <strong>Time Exceeded</strong> messages, according to
    <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc792">ICMP (RFC 792)</a>,
    in order to implement a <tt><strong>traceroute</strong></tt> program, which prints the sequence of
    IP addresses in the network along the shortest path from the node
    where <tt><strong>traceroute</strong></tt> is launched
    to the node of the user's target address.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc793">TCP (RFC 793)</a> implementation
    can transfer a 5 MB file in a few seconds, and guarantees <strong>zero packet loss</strong>, even 
    over a channel that sporadically drops packets.
  </p>

  <p>
    As part of my senior capstone requirements, I implemented <strong>TCP Tahoe</strong> for congestion control,
    which involves <strong>Slow Start</strong>, <strong>Congestion Avoidance</strong>,
    and <strong>Fast Retransmit</strong> from
    <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5681/">RFC 5681</a>.

      Code for this project is <strong>not</strong> public on GitHub,
      but can be made available on request.
